# The-Quest-for-the-Crystal-Kingdom_Game

This C++ project is designed to determine the Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path in a graph, focusing on a randomly generated crystal's starting point and destination. Utilizing algorithms like Floyd, Prim, Kruskal, and Dijkstra, it efficiently computes optimal routes. Key features include MST computation via Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, as well as Shortest Path determination using Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms. The project also showcases concepts like random graph generation, score calculation with AVL trees, and usage of data structures like heaps and disjoint sets. To get started, clone the repository, compile the code, and run the program, following on-screen instructions. Contributions are welcome via issues or pull requests.
